# Meme Generator
Third project taught by Scrimba's Introduction to React course

In this section of the course I was introduced how to work with "forms" and "useEffect" in React. I have to say that it took me quite some time to wrap my head around it. I still have to along way to go/practice to be able to say that I'm familiar with the topic, but I'm ready to practice. 

In this app, you get random images of (argurably) trendy memes, and you can also customize your own context for the meme.
